# Listening To Yourself 

What is your taste in music? Let's find out, and maybe discover new bops along the way.

## Description

Curious about your listening habits? Well, let's trace back to what you have been listening to for the past weeks, months, or years. You can request some recommendations based on the top tracks. You will be able to listen and add the recommendations to an existing playlist if needed. Furthermore, learn about your current musical moods and how they represent you. Discover who you are based on what you listen to.

## Development Mode

This Web Application is currently in DEVELOPMENT MODE which SPOTIFY only allows USERS that are manually added into their user management in order to show users their contents. I will be requesting a 'Quota Extension' from Spotify to be able to make this web application public to everyone. In the meantime, please submit this easy form with your Spotify's email in order to see contents. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFKP8TXioxqkKFmTRMcChEEm3W9Fnv8TcX6unll4ysF4x_Iw/viewform
